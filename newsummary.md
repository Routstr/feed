# New Summary Feature Development Progress

## Overview
Implementation of a "New Summary" button with modal popup interface for creating new summaries with npub and instruction inputs.

## Changes Made

### Date: 2025-09-05

#### Files Modified:
- `src/App.jsx` - Main application component

#### Implementation Details:

**Phase 1: Initial Input Box Implementation**
- Added input box above feed summary side box
- Included "New Summary" button
- Added state management for input handling

**Phase 2: Modal Popup Implementation (Final)**
- Replaced input box with simple "New Summary" button
- Created modal popup with overlay and proper styling
- Added two form fields:
  1. **npub**: Text input field for entering npub
  2. **instruction**: Textarea with pre-filled editable text

#### Code Changes in `src/App.jsx`:

**State Management Added:**
```javascript
const [showSummaryModal, setShowSummaryModal] = useState(false)
const [npubInput, setNpubInput] = useState('')
const [instructionInput, setInstructionInput] = useState('Posts that contain useful information that educate me in someway or the other. Shitposting should be avoided. Low effort notes should be avoided.')
```

**Handler Functions Added:**
- `handleNewSummary()` - Opens the modal
- `handleSubmitSummary()` - Processes form submission and closes modal
- `handleCloseModal()` - Closes modal without submitting

**UI Components Added:**
- Full-width "New Summary" button in sidebar
- Modal popup with backdrop overlay
- Form with npub input and instruction textarea
- Cancel and Submit buttons
- Close (X) button in modal header

#### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Modal overlay with click-to-close backdrop
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Dark/light theme compatibility
- ✅ Pre-populated instruction text (editable)
- ✅ Proper form state management
- ✅ Accessible design with labels
- ✅ Clean UI matching existing app design

#### Default Instruction Text:
"Posts that contain useful information that educate me in someway or the other. Shitposting should be avoided. Low effort notes should be avoided."

#### Additional Implementation - POST Request & localStorage Integration

**Phase 3: Backend Integration & Data Persistence**
- Implemented POST request functionality to `http://localhost:8080/run`
- Added timestamp input fields for user control
- Integrated localStorage for response caching
- Modified data loading to prioritize stored summaries

**New State Variables Added:**
```javascript
const [currTimestampInput, setCurrTimestampInput] = useState(() => Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000))
const [sinceInput, setSinceInput] = useState(() => Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - (24 * 60 * 60))
```

**Updated Handler Functions:**

**`handleSubmitSummary()` - Enhanced with API Integration:**
- Makes POST request to `http://localhost:8080/run`
- Uses user-provided timestamp values from input fields
- Stores empty JSON `{}` in localStorage before request (key: `summary_${curr_timestamp}`)
- Stores response JSON in localStorage after successful request
- Includes error handling and console logging

**`handleNewSummary()` - Enhanced with Timestamp Reset:**
- Resets timestamp inputs to current values when opening modal
- Maintains user-friendly defaults (current time and 24 hours ago)

**New Form Fields Added:**
1. **curr_timestamp**: Number input for current timestamp
2. **since**: Number input for "since" timestamp (24 hours ago by default)
3. **npub**: Text input (existing)
4. **instruction**: Textarea (existing)

**localStorage Implementation:**
- **Storage Key Pattern**: `summary_${curr_timestamp}` (e.g., `summary_1725537408`)
- **Pre-request**: Stores `{}` to mark request initiation
- **Post-response**: Stores actual response JSON for caching
- **Retrieval**: App checks localStorage on startup for existing summaries

**Data Loading Enhancement:**
- Modified initial data loading logic in `useState(() => {...})`
- Scans localStorage for keys starting with `summary_`
- Filters out empty objects (initial `{}` placeholders)
- Loads first valid stored summary if available
- Falls back to `sampleData` if no stored summaries exist
- Includes console logging for debugging

**API Request Format:**
```javascript
POST http://localhost:8080/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "npub": "user_input_npub",
  "since": user_input_timestamp,
  "curr_timestamp": user_input_timestamp
}
```

#### Features Completed:
- ✅ POST request to backend API
- ✅ Timestamp input fields with auto-population
- ✅ localStorage caching system
- ✅ Automatic loading of stored summaries
- ✅ Fallback to sample data when no summaries exist
- ✅ Error handling and console logging
- ✅ User-controlled timestamp values

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add form validation for timestamp inputs
- [ ] Add loading states during POST request
- [ ] Implement summary list management (view all stored summaries)
- [ ] Add delete functionality for stored summaries
- [ ] Add success/error notifications for API requests

## Technical Notes
- Modal uses fixed positioning with z-index 50
- Form inputs use consistent styling with existing components
- State management follows React best practices
- Modal can be closed via backdrop click, X button, or Cancel button
- localStorage keys follow pattern: `summary_${timestamp}`
- App prioritizes stored summaries over sample data on startup
- API integration includes proper error handling and response caching
